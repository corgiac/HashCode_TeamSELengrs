	DESCRIPTION: Solving a given problem (retrieved from the 'Google Hash Code 2020' competition).

	Amazing Arrays!
	
	This project explores the manipulation and calculation of larger data sets. We have designed a blackjack-type scenario to take
	data from a file and sum that data to get close to a number. The rules are that you may not use a single value more than once
	and you may not exceed the blackjack number. 
	
	We will use arrays as our data structure which we have not learned in class yet to store and organize the data.
	
	The data sets consist of 5 seperate files which contain an increasing number of values ranging from 4 to 10,000 values.
	We will scan in using several different loop types. Each data file has two lines of data.

	The first line, first entry is the Blackjack integer value that we are trying to come close to. 
	The first line, second entry is the integer value that represents the total number of individual enteries in the second line.
	
	The second line consists of all the unique integer values that we will be summing together to get as close to
	the first entry as possible.
	
	This is a program developed in Visual Studio.
